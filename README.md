<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>You have been asked to build a currency exchange calculator.</p>
<p>Use the data from <a href="https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest">this url</a> to allow the user to convert from Euro to any of the listed currencies.</p>
<h2>MVP</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>convert from Euros into a selected currency</li>
  <li>convert from a selected currency into Euros</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ul>

<li>Research how Vueâ€™s filters allow for formatting of output and implement them where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
